# VIBECODING FINDINGS

- very nice to find a quick solution to things
- you gotta treat it like an eager junior, set boundaries, explain exactly what you want
- it is very good at finding bugs
- it does test-driven development (Pilot), which is very useful
- it can make very stupid design mistakes, so still design your own structure
- changing stuff around tends to increase the mess up to a point where your code contains
- does not eliminate dead code
